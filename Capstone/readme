Restaurant aggregator like Zomato sells groceries to restaurants. Zomato calls that vertical Zomato 
Hyperpure. But, according to DART, restaurants are not opting for Zomato or discontinuing it because of 
the narrower catalogue & poor availability in terms of quantity required. We are here with our project to 
help them figure out how such issues can be handled. Based on the dishes a restaurant sells, our AI-based 
framework can identify all the necessary ingredients needed to prepare them. For a given dish, our 
algorithm searches several websites that publish the recipe of the dish and extract all the ingredients
needed to cook the dish. Not just that it also extracts the quantity of each ingredient required to cook the 
dish for a single person. The same can be applied to all the dishes a restaurant sell. With such estimations
and projected sales for the dish, it would be possible to properly manage their inventory with useful items 
in appropriate quantities. Such an application can solve the problem of a narrower catalogue and poor 
availability.
